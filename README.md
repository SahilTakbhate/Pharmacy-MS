Pharmacy Management System (Dot Net fullstack using C#)
Pharmacy Management System case study. 
In this case study there are two different users 1. admin user and    2. doctor user. 
Admin is main operator of the pharmacy. He is handling all the functionalities in the pharmacy like view drugs, add/edit drugs, delete drugs, view all the orders placed by doctor user, if order is valid, he can verify that order and can then add that order into picked up orders section if the order has been picked up, view suppliers, add/edit suppliers, delete supplier, view sales report, print sales report, download sales report, etc.
The doctor user will be able to see all the drugs available in the pharmacy and place order according to the requirement.
Using ASP.Net MVC and a bit of angular for frontend and designing of the application.
Web API will be used to process all the HTTP rewuests and also to build RESTful Services.
SQL Server will be used to store data in the database.
Uses of Our Application :

Here are some potential uses of our application :

Efficient drug procurement : Doctors can use the web app to easily browse through the drugs listed by suppliers, compare prices, and make purchases, thereby streamlining the procurement process.
Improved inventory management : Drug suppliers can use the web app to manage their inventory and track sales, allowing them to better plan their production and supply chain operations.
Enhanced transparency : The web app can provide a transparent platform for both doctors and suppliers, allowing them to see pricing and availability of drugs in real-time, helping to prevent any potential market distortions.
Secure payment processing : The web app can provide a secure payment gateway to facilitate financial transactions between doctors and suppliers, helping to prevent any fraud and ensuring prompt payment for drugs.
Robust data management : The web app can also provide a centralized data management system for both doctors and suppliers, allowing them to easily access and update their records, track their purchases and sales, and generate reports on their operations.
Overall, a web app with two logins for drug suppliers and doctors can help improve the efficiency, transparency, and security of the drug procurement process, benefiting both parties and ultimately improving patient care.
